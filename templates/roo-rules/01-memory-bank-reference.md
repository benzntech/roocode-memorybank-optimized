# Memory Bank Reference

This file provides Roo with context from the memory bank. The memory bank is a structured system for maintaining project context and history.

## Memory Bank Structure

The memory bank contains the following key files:

1. **activeContext.md** - Current development focus and recent changes
2. **productContext.md** - Project overview, goals, and core features
3. **systemPatterns.md** - Architectural and design patterns
4. **decisionLog.md** - Important decisions and their rationale
5. **progress.md** - Current, completed, and upcoming tasks

## Usage Guidelines

- When suggesting code changes, consider the active context and system patterns
- Respect decisions documented in the decision log
- Align responses with the project's goals and features
- Maintain consistency with established architectural patterns

## Project Overview

The project is focused on creating a memory bank system that helps maintain context and history for software development projects. It provides a structured way to document active context, product information, system patterns, and decisions.

This information helps developers and AI assistants maintain awareness of the project's current state, goals, and architectural choices.
